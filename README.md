Uses cuepoints put into a video edited with [Premare Pro](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html) or [After Effects](https://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html).
Then when playing back it will wait at the cuepoints for the space button to be pressed.
This will let use use normal videos for presentations allowing for more advanced graphics and animations, while still allowing you to keep perfect timing.
Video playback is handled through [libmpv](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv), so you can use like almost any video format.
